## Brief overview
  This set of guidelines is project-specific to the UseCaseSimulator development workflow, focusing on consistent task identification and reporting practices.

## Task identification
  - Always display the Task number (e.g., T4-001) and week number (e.g., Week 4) when mentioning or referencing any task from the project kanban board
  - Include both elements together in task descriptions, status updates, and completion summaries
  - Use the format "T#-###: Task Name (Week #)" when listing tasks in todo lists or progress reports

## Communication style
  - Maintain concise, direct responses while ensuring all task references include the required identification elements
  - When updating task status or providing summaries, explicitly state the task ID and week to maintain clarity

## Development workflow
  - Reference tasks by their full identifier (Task ID + Week) in all progress updates and completion confirmations
  - Ensure todo lists display tasks with their complete identification for tracking purposes
